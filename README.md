This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router DOM v6 where a state update attempts to happen on an unmounted component, triggering a warning about a potential memory leak.  The issue arises from asynchronous operations or cleanup not being handled properly during component unmounting.  The solution provided addresses this by using useEffect hook with cleanup function to ensure any state updates are canceled when the component unmounts.
